### Day 5: 2020-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my company website, a PHP contact me form, and my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** PHP may not work on my hosted website, but I need the practice.

### Day 6: 2020-02-29

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio website. Created a JSON file to hold my portfolio projects data. Dynamically load each project from the JSON file into a bootstrap card class.

**Thoughts:** Was able to get the javascript to work, however I still need to determine an appealing style for displaying each project.
