### Day 5: 2020-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my company website, a PHP contact me form, and my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** PHP may not work on my hosted website, but I need the practice.

### Day 6: 2020-02-29

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio website. Created a JSON file to hold my portfolio projects data. Dynamically load each project from the JSON file into a bootstrap card class.

**Thoughts:** Was able to get the javascript to work, however I still need to determine an appealing style for displaying each project.

### Day 7: 2020-03-01

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up one of my older angular apps.  Contact list management.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how much better my code is now compared to that of which I did 6 months ago.

### Day 8: 2020-03-02

**Today's Progress**: Continued cleaning up an older angular contact list management app.

**Thoughts:** It really shows how hard it is to remember something that you coded after some time has passed.

### Day 10: 2020-03-04

**Today's Progress**: Setup restful API / MongoDB tests using Supertest, Chai, and Mocha

**Thoughts:** It seems like a lot of people complain about writing tests, that there is not enough "time".  I really like TDD, it helps development once it is setup, and is a quick way to know if you break your code down the road.
