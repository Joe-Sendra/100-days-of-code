### Day 5: 2020-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my company website, a PHP contact me form, and my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** PHP may not work on my hosted website, but I need the practice.

### Day 6: 2020-02-29

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio website. Created a JSON file to hold my portfolio projects data. Dynamically load each project from the JSON file into a bootstrap card class.

**Thoughts:** Was able to get the javascript to work, however I still need to determine an appealing style for displaying each project.

### Day 7: 2020-03-01

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up one of my older angular apps.  Contact list management.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe how much better my code is now compared to that of which I did 6 months ago.

**Link to work:**
* [Angular-Contact-List-Management](https://github.com/Joe-Sendra/Angular-Contact-List-Management/commit/0d36e3ee075b84adbc0dfe4a2d3eebb9e3e2b6d2)

### Day 8: 2020-03-02

**Today's Progress**: Continued cleaning up an older angular contact list management app.

**Thoughts:** It really shows how hard it is to remember something that you coded after some time has passed.

**Link to work:**
* [Angular-Contact-List-Management](https://github.com/Joe-Sendra/Angular-Contact-List-Management/commit/32a7f0646e0909054371e21cdb4a7f33d4a2607b)

### Day 9: 2020-03-03

**Today's Progress**: Refactored PATCH method on BugTracker API from 61 lines to 13!

**Thoughts:** Clean code is fun!

### Day 10: 2020-03-04

**Today's Progress**: Setup restful API / MongoDB tests using Supertest, Chai, and Mocha

**Thoughts:** It seems like a lot of people complain about writing tests, that there is not enough "time".  I really like TDD, it helps development once it is setup, and is a quick way to know if you break your code down the road.

* [BugTracker-BackEnd (test)](https://github.com/Joe-Sendra/bugTracker-Backend/tree/test)

### Day 11: 2020-03-05

**Today's Progress**: TDD Restful API. 18 tests passing, 2 pending

**Thoughts:** TDD really helps me be productive

* [BugTracker-BackEnd](https://github.com/Joe-Sendra/bugTracker-Backend/commit/03751c31797c52525c4cf93e511c2d59b5692cc2)

### Day 12: 2020-03-06

**Today's Progress**: More tests, more refactoring

**Thoughts:** I am amazed at how different the tests shape how you program

**Today's Progress**: Continued the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
  * in-progress JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts:** Still 1 project left to get certification! Worked on it for a while, but had to cut it short.  I have a good feeling about tomorrow.

### Day 23: 2020-03-18

**Today's Progress**: Continued the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
  * in-progress JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts:** Still 1 project left to get certification! It is the project that never ends.  I think I have just too mentally drained after work to give this project the thought it needs.  It is not hard, but I feel like I start to drift and just end up doing circles.
