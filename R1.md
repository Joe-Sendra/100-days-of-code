### Day 10: 2020-03-04

**Today's Progress**: Setup restful API / MongoDB tests using Supertest, Chai, and Mocha

**Thoughts:** It seems like a lot of people complain about writing tests, that there is not enough "time".  I really like TDD, it helps development once it is setup, and is a quick way to know if you break your code down the road.
